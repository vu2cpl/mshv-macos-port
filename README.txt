New in version 2.76.5:	2026-03-24
Added: For All FT modes widget for manual DT correction, closer to clock widget.
	If manual DT correction is active, will be flashing in red color, if value is zero, stop flashing (no correction).
	How to use, just set value from DT column for you correspondent, after the end of QSO set to zero.
Changed: Tune period for all modes to 20-29 sec.
Enabled: In menu decode Check-Button for average decode in mode FT2.
