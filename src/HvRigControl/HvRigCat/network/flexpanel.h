/*
 * Native Flex VITA-49 control / monitor panel.
 *
 * A small non-modal window showing the radio's own meters and offering the
 * two controls that are awkward to reach otherwise: antenna and mode.
 *
 * Everything here is driven from what the radio reports. The antenna and mode
 * dropdowns are populated from the slice's own ant_list / tx_ant_list /
 * mode_list, so MSHV never offers a choice the radio would reject, and the
 * lists follow the hardware rather than a table that goes stale.
 *
 * The panel is inert when the Flex backend is not running: it simply shows
 * that it is not connected.
 * MSHV Native FlexRadio VITA-49 audio and control backend, was created by Manoj Ramawarrier, VU2CPL 2026
